**Example:**

*   You (and your computer) are in the CST time zone (GMT - 6).
*   Device 1 is in the EST time zone (GMT - 5).
*   Device 2 is in the PST time zone (GMT - 8).

You set a schedule item to play from 10 AM to 11 AM on 1/1/20XX.

*   Device 1 will play the schedule item from 10 AM to 11 AM on 1/1/20XX in its local time (EST).
*   Device 2 will play the schedule item from 10 AM to 11 AM on 1/1/20XX in its local time (PST).

Daylight saving time adjustments will be handled automatically.

* * *

## Frequently Asked Questions About Schedules

**What if there is a one-time schedule overlapping a recurring schedule?**

The one-time schedule will take priority.

**Example:**

*   Recurring schedule A (9 AM - 5 PM daily) overlaps with a one-time schedule B (10 AM - 11 AM) today.

**Playback Order:**

*   9 AM - 10 AM: Recurring schedule A
*   10 AM - 11 AM: Single schedule B
*   11 AM - 5 PM: Recurring schedule A resumes

**What if there are two recurring schedules overlapping?**

The most recently created/ updated schedule will take priority.

**What happens when there's nothing scheduled?**

If there is no scheduled content, the screen will display a black screen by default. To avoid this, you can set default content. There are two ways to do this:

*   **At the Schedule Level:** Edit the specific schedule, click on **Settings**, and select your preferred default content (None, Account Default, Asset, or Playlist).

[![](/hc/article_attachments/30102222667539)](/hc/article_attachments/30102222667539)

*   **At the Account Level:** Apply a default content setting that will apply to all newly created schedules. The schedule-level setting will take priority if both are set.
